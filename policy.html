            <h1>Customer Policy</h1>
            <h2>Our policy ensures a positive customer experience.</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p><strong class="goldy">No Makeup</strong>
                Please remove all makeup prior to services to get the maximum amount of time for your appointment.

                Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> curl your natural eyelashes and <strong>DO</strong> remove all eye makeup with a mild, oil-free cleanser prior to your appointment. Eye makeup can interfere with the adhesive bond and shorten the lifespan of your lash extensions, so itâ€™s very important your natural lashes be as clean as possible.

                If you are a contact lens wearer, please remove them.

                <strong class="goldy">Late Policy</strong>
                Should you be running late, we will hold your appointment for 15 minutes provided we hear from you. If you are more than 15 minutes late, we may need to shorten your service, or your appointment may need to be rescheduled in order to remain on time for all our clients.

                <strong class="goldy">Reservations &amp; Cancellations</strong>
                Extensive and/or multiple salon services may require a major credit card to secure your appointment.

                If you must reschedule or cancel your appointment(s), please notify us 24 hours in advance to avoid an automatic credit card charge of percentage of the service total.

            </p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>A cancellation fee of <strong>50% applies for cancellations or any changes made less than 24 hours</strong> in advance, or in case of no-show.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <strong class="goldy">Allergies</strong>
                We do not offer refunds on allergic reactions. If you are sensitive, or have had a reaction before please let our tech know and we will do a patch test.

                <strong class="goldy">Phone Policy</strong>
                We ask before you enter our salon that you please turn your phone off, and make any calls or texts before appointments.

                <strong class="goldy">Child Safety</strong>
                We love children and we hope you understand. We cannot assure their safety in the salon.

                We also do not want to compromise the relaxation and salon experience of our guests. Children are only permitted in the salon area when having a service.  For safety and insurance purposes, no child under the age of 12 may accompany you while you are having a service.

                We do not have the facilities to care for children. Your understanding is greatly appreciated.

                <strong class="goldy">Lash Fills</strong>
                For booking a lash fill appointment, the price and appointment time are different depending on how often you come back for a fill.

                Please check your schedule carefully. We will correct your appointment to the corresponding (1-6) week fill/full set if needed.

                <strong class="goldy">Age Restrictions</strong>
                This salon cannot provide the service to minors under the age of 18 years without a parent or a guardianâ€™s presence. The salon will not accept any form of payments from a minor. It is the responsibility of the parent/guardian to make a payment on behalf of the minor.

                Clients under the age of 18 years will require a parent or guardian to sign a consent form for certain treatments.

                <strong class="goldy">Gratuity</strong>
                Gratuity (tipping) is up to the discretion of each client. The industry average is 15%-20% of the services total prior to discount or incentive offers.

                Our team greatly appreciates your generosity. ðŸ˜Š
